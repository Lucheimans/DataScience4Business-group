## Why was data driven decision making (3DM) useful in this business case?

Netflix has the advantage of an online movie-watching platform that can track (on a large scale) the user's viewing rate and completion rate. For example, could Netflix collect data on how many users who started watching Game of throne (from season 1) completed it through season 3? For example, 70%. At the same time, where is Netflix also able to get data on what are popular viewing stops for users? What did the other 30% of users do? What is the time gap when consumers watch one episode and when they watch the next?

## How did the organization apply 3DM?

Netflix collects customer feedback and interaction data with a television show in real time. For example, Netflix knows the time and date the user watched a show, the device used, if the show is paused, will the viewer continue watching after pausing. Netflix even has screenshots of scenes people may have watched multiple times, what ratings are given, how many searches, and what content is searched. With this data, Netflix is able to create detailed profiles of its users. From there, Netflix uses a recommendation algorithm to recommend TV shows and movies based on user preferences.


## What can the organization do with 3DM that they couldnâ€™t do before?

Netflix even uses big data and data analytics to do custom marketing. For example, to promote a movie Netflix will cut more than ten different versions of the trailer to promote the show. If you've watched a lot of TV shows focusing on women, you'll have a trailer focusing on female characters. Netflix doesn't have to spend too much time and resources on program marketing because they already know how many people will be interested in it and what will encourage them to tune in.While in the past, the company took a lot of time to synthesize and track customers in a traditional approach.

## What was the business problem?

Small farmers business in today world are facing a lot of problems such as the competition from big factory farmers ,unreliable  weather conditions leads to difficult demand forecasting, the farmers don't know what time they should harvest their products and how many products they should harvest . The short shelf life of their products is also an condition need to be monitored to prevent product spoiling during transportation or after it is delivered to the customer.

## How was it translated into a data mining problem?

Based on the case study in the video mentioned above, to solve this problem they built an ecommerce site to collect and track buyers' data,
Based on customer registration data they can create a predictive chart of demand for farmers from which orders will be processed weekly, and selling online will help farmers. is not limited by the surrounding geography and the number of markets they can sell.
in addition, demand data will allow the farmer to predict which crops will be planted next in the future or how much will be harvested.
The last is to use data from deliveries to optimize shipping routes.


## What is the realized business value?

The use of bigdata to analyze and plan cultivation and sales of small farms helps to build a better and comprehensive food system.
Using customer demand forecasting data helps farmers know how many they have to grow and harvest for which varieties,this can improve food wastage due to some products with short lifecycle rot
In addition, the farmers can exchange data with each other to bench mark, which in turn can help each other come up with more effective strategies in the future.

## What features define a data driven business?
According to Techopedia, Data-driven is an adjective used to refer to a process or activity driven by data, as opposed to being driven by intuition or personal experience.

To put it simply, regardless of the business, which company uses data analysis to come to a decision, it is called data driven.

For example, based on data collected from customers, Amazon has embraced their mentality and behavior to come up with technology solutions for add-ons such as Amazon Alexa (self-co-based customer care robot system. on AI technology) - fast shopping support and limited movement to brick and mortar stores.



## What are the important features of a data culture?
According to harvard business review and Amazon web service (AWS) to establish business efficiency with focus around data .Characteristics of data oriented companies should include:

- Balancing the quantity and quality of internal and external data to ensure efficiency in data storage and extraction to avoid overload and interference
- C-suite is also an important factor, the Board of Directors not only understands what's going on internally, but can also possess useful external information like trends and important news.
that we may not know. Therefore, an integral part of a data-focused and focused culture is the regular holding of many knowledge sharing sessions with senior management.

- The data is easily accessible by employees, the ease of being here does not mean that the employee can access any data, but the employee can access the data they need quickly. fast and simple through tools such as smart phones, laptops, etc ...

- Data-oriented companies need to have a complete data management system with policies and requirements set out in data management, to ensure data management and improvement, especially master data.



## What are the transformation steps towards a mature data driven business?

Basic steps for businesses to successfully digital transformation :

1. Evaluate the current status and expectations of the business

The first step in the digital transformation process is for a leader to be clear about the digital transformation in the business and to understand market trends. Leaders need to spend time thinking about an end result that digital transformation will bring, such as prioritizing increasing sales or reducing uptime.

2. Evaluate the enterprise's willingness to convert digitally
This job requires businesses to meet two factors: people and data.
- Human factors
This is the most important factor. After all, technology is just a tool. In other words, the success of technology transformation will be determined in the mindset and vision from the leadership levels to all employees.

- Data factor
Data is an indispensable component in building digital transitions. However, in addition to analyzing existing data within the enterprise, executives need to pay attention to the data of their strategic partners as well as their competitors. From there, have an overview of the enterprise value chain before entering the race of technology transformation.

3. Review the process to make the necessary changes and select the right technology
More specifically, after understanding what the business data is reflecting, leaders need to see the signs to gauge a business's process maturity. From there, businesses can know where they are and are ready for the technology transformation or not. Again, decision makers should not rely on visual inferences, but need the most specific and detailed data to find a reasonable direction for the business.

4. Create an open feedback culture

Digital transformation cannot be successful if it only comes from the leadership of the business. Open communication is a key component in building a technology transformation process. Management and employee feedback play an important role together. Based on this feedback, leaders can make changes to optimize training effectiveness. To encourage constructive feedback, foster open discussions, open mind, and collaborate.
